# **Algorithms for analyzing subject text and synthesizing sentences in Ukrainian** #

The program was written in **C++**, which is an efficient and fast programming language that allowed us to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately.

Our work is based on the statistical analysis of text data and the generation of new sentences or texts based on this data. We developed a program that takes text input and analyzes it, keeping statistics on word usage and transitions between words. To do this, we used **std::unordered_map** containers, which allow quick access to data and efficient search. We also used regular expressions for text processing during the execution of our project. Regular expressions are a special language used to search and manipulate text strings. 

We used the **regex** library in the **C++** programming language, which provides convenient tools for working with regular expressions. In particular, we used the **std::regex_replace** function to remove some characters from words before parsing them and generating text.

**Regular expressions** allow us to process text more accurately and efficiently, to extract the necessary elements from it, and to analyze data. The use of regular expressions in our project has greatly simplified the processing of input data and increased the accuracy of text generation.

To synthesize a new text, we used a weighted random selection algorithm that takes into account the frequency of words and their transitions.

Based on our research, we have concluded that the use of statistical analysis and weighted random selection algorithms is an effective approach to generating new text from input data. Our program can be used in various industries.

 For example:

- **Duolingo**. Our program is able to analyze text and create incorrect answer choices along with correct ones that have a similar context. This can create a challenge for the user when choosing the right answer, increasing the level of difficulty of the task.

This algorithm can be used in any similar applications where you need to create incorrect answers based on the topic of the question.

- **Dialog generation**. This code can be used to generate random texts that have a similar context to the English-language negotiations between pilots and the airport. Such generated texts can be used to train pilots on how to communicate effectively and accurately in similar situations, or they can be used to test pilot knowledge in accordance with international standards. This approach can be useful for preparing pilots for real-life negotiations, as well as for improving their skills in interacting with air traffic controllers.
- **Dictation generation**. Our program can be trained on typical simple sentences and other texts and generate dictations for different ages, levels, and vocabularies.
- **Creating a machine learning model**. Our program can be used to improve understanding of people's queries and the context in which they are used. Analyzing textual data and determining the frequency of words and their context can help create a machine learning model that can be used to improve understanding of people's queries that contain similar words or phrases. For example, if a machine learning program has seen a lot of queries about the weather, it can create a model that understands that the question "What's the weather like today?" is related to the words "weather" and "today." This can help machine intelligence better understand the context of the query and answer it more accurately.
